## 🎯 Why This Repo?

Research papers are the source of truth in AI, but they can be time-consuming and complex.  
This repo simplifies learning with:

✅ Visual annotations  
✅ Color-coded highlights  
✅ Key takeaways  
✅ Focused understanding — not just skimming

## 🎨 Color Code System

To make the learning process more structured, each paper is annotated using this consistent system:

| Color    | Meaning                                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 🔴 Red   | Core Concepts — must-understand ideas             |
| 🟡 Yellow| Implementation Details — equations, algorithms     |
| 🟢 Green | Practical Insights — real-world relevance          |
| 🔵 Blue  | Open Research — ideas that spark further thought   |

Use this as your guide to quickly identify what matters most while reading.
